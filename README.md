# html-css-Selectors
CSS selectors are key for styling It include:  
Class (`.`):targets elements with a specific class, 
ID (`#`):targets an element with a unique ID.
Universal (`*`):selects all elements on a page.
Attribute (`[]`):selects elements with an attribute.

### HTML and CSS Explanation:

1. Element Selector (`p`):
   - Targets all `<p>` elements.
   - In the CSS, `p { color: red; }` changes the text color of all paragraphs to red.

2. Class Selector (`.note`):
   - Targets elements with the class `note`.
   - `font-size: 20px;` sets the font size of all elements with `class="note"` to 20px.

3. ID Selector (`#id-selector-demo`):
   - Targets the specific element with the ID `id-selector-demo`.
   - `color: green;` applies green color to the `<li>` with that ID.

4. Attribute Selector (`li[value="4"]`):
   - Selects the `<li>` element with the `value="4"` attribute.
   - `color: blue;` applies blue color to that specific list item.

5. Universal Selector (`*`):
   - Targets all elements on the page.
   - `text-align: center;` centers the text for every element.

These selectors allow you to apply styles to specific parts of the HTML based on tags, classes, IDs, attributes, or globally to all elements.
